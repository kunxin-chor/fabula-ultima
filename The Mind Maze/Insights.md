Insights grant permanent upgrade to the Sphere of Thoughts, strengthening the created Mind Maze from the host's memories.

* Each time you are defeated in the Mind Maze and has to reset, you gain 2 Insight Points
* Each time the Mind Maze drops in one **tier** of stability, you gain 2 Insight Points
* Each core memories that you arrive at gives 2 Insight Points
* When you finish a Mind Maze by clearing the destination, you gain 10 Insight Points

## Spending Insights
Each benefit you add to the Sphere of Thoughts costs different amount of Insight Points.

* Devotion (10 Insight Points): Choose one Icon of your choice to devote to. You may purchase boons that Icon without finding their shrine. Each time you purchase this, choose one more Icon to devote to. No matter how many Icons you devote to, at the start of a run, you may only unlock access to the boons of two Icons maximum. 
	* **Offering** (10 Insight Points): All the `Obol` costs of Icons which you are devoted to cost 1 less.
	* **Resolve** (10 Insight Points): On the turn when you unlock (not activate) a boon from an Icon you are devoted to, regain `1 Stability` in the current tier clock.
	* Favor (20 Insight Points): When you come across a Shrine and it is randomly determined to be one that you are devoted to, unlock the next tier boon for free.
	* Advocate (10 Insight Points): Once per run in a Mind Maze, you can perform the `Petition` action even if it is on cooldown.

* Legacy (10 Insight Points): When you begin a new run of a Mind Maze, you begin with `3 Obols`. Each time you purchase `Legacy`, increase its `Insight` cost by 5. (So the first time you purchase this, it costs `10 Insight`. The second time, `15 Insight`. The third time, `20 Insight`)
* Oracle (10 Insight Points): Gain 2 rerolls for determining shards or paths. One reroll from this insight can only be used once per turn. If purchased again, the number of rerolls increase to 3. You may not purchase this more than twice.
