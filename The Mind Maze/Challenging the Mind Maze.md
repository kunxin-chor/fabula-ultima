# Introduction
The Mind Maze  refers to a illusory landscape or dimension created from the memories of one that has been processed by the **Sphere of Thoughts**. Travelers may delve into the Mind Shard, viewing their memories as **active participants**. There's no easy way to travel through the Mind Shard incognito, by default.

The dimension rendered by the Sphere of Thoughts follow physical and magical rules. It is not clear how this works yet but it seems that the created dimension follows the **expectation** of its host.  Creatures and people created in the memories act as the host would expect. 

When travelling through a Mind Shard, **backtracking** is usually forbidden. 

# Tour of a Mind Shard
* **The Anchor**: This is the starting point of all Travelers in a Mind Shard. At the Anchor, you regain all `MP`, `HP` and `IP`, and purge all status effects.
* **Shard**: A shard represents an event, an important memory of sorts, for the host of the mind shard. Every shard has an **exit**. Every exit will be some form of **transition point** that is unnatural (For example a door painted in the wall, a set of stairs leading to nowhere, etc.)
* **Path**: A path links two shards, allow travelers to move between them. A path is **sealed** after Travelers move across it. This means that in a Mind Shard, you cannot **backtrack**.
* **Destination Shard:** The Sphere of Thoughts can pinpoint which shard contains the memories you want.
* **Stability:** The dimension created by a Sphere of Thoughts isn't stable. The more time is spent within the Mind Shard, the more unstable it becomes. 
* **Icons:** It seems that powers of Icons are amplified in a Mind Shard. Every Mind Shard is aligned to one or two Icons, and align against. Aspect of the Icons worshipped or embraced by the Host.
* Unstable Mind Shards invite **incursions**. Those are astral parasites, dimensional travelers and eldritch wanderers that walk between planes and dimension. 

## Travelling through a Shard
* To travel from one shard to another, there must be a pathway between them
* It takes one **turn** to move from one shard to another.
* Usually, you will only know what **type** of shard and pathway you traveling on when you enter them. Due to the strain of  sustaining an entire dimension, usually a random memory of the host is **only** created when you choose which path to go.
* At any time, you can choose to **reset** your journey in the Mind Shard, starting again from the Anchor. However, the shards and paths you have visited remained the same. Shards that have been have their nature become **blanks**. However, the nature of discovered paths stay the same. The Stability of the current Mind Maze also reduce by 1.
* **Manifestation:** Sometimes shards unrelated to the direct memories of the Host appears. Those could be related to the stories, tales or concepts known by the Host, but have are not events that are experienced by the Host.
* **Defeat**: If a party is completely defeated in a Mind Shard, they must restart at the **Anchor**. The `Stability` remains unchanged..
* **Obols**: Those strange, irregular shaped coins are the only currency recognized by the recreated vendors and people in a Mind Shard. Somehow in the memories, all coinage have been replaced by those strange coins. Obols are destroyed when you exit a Mind Maze.
* **Insights**: The Mind Maze is still a mysterious to those who have inherited the Sphere of Thoughts. Insights collected in a Mind Maze can be used to upgrade the Sphere of Thoughts.
* **Reconstruction**: If for some reason a Mind Shard poses so much challenge that it cannot be cleared, the Travelers can choose to reconstruct a Mind Shard. However, they will need to stab the Host with the Mindtheft Dagger again, or they can choose to take a campaign setback. You also lose all Obols that you have collected. Reconstructing a Mind Maze means that you have to travel again from the Anchor, and the nature of each shards and paths will be randomly determined again.
* **Splitting the Party**: You may split the party if you desire more efficiency. The `Stability` of a Mind Maze depends on the number of turns, so if you split into two sub-parties, you can explore the Mind Maze faster. Take note that communication via Stone of Sending is possible. However the only way to merge the party if there is no converging path is to reset the Mind Maze. 
## Types of Shards

> [!NOTE]
> When you survey or enter a `shard`, a random card is drawn to determine the nature of the `shard`, then that card is discarded. 

There are generally a few types of shards that are possible:
* Challenge: Memories that revolve around the time when the host faces a challenge. 
* Conflict: Events in the Host's past where the Host is in direct opposition to some forces, usually combat.
* Investigation: A chance to peek around in the mind of the host, uncovering more clues and information
* Treasure: Chance of gaining obols or insights.
* Aspect: The shard contains a manifestation of an aspect of an Icon. The Icon in question is one that is embraced or opposed by the Host.
* Event: A random event occurs
* Rest: This is usually a usually a good memory in the mind of the Host.  You can take a short rest and regain 30% of your current `HP` and `MP` (but no `IP`) and don't incur any `Stability` loss, or take a long rest which will incur the usual `Stability` loss but recover all `HP` and `MP` and remove all status effects.
* Trauma: A time when the Host faces a tremendous setback. Expect stiff challenge here but great rewards.
* Shrine: When you come across a Shrine, the GM will randomly choose one Icon it is for. You can now purchase boons from this Icon by choosing the `Petition` role action in subsequent travel turns.
* Merchant: At a Merchant you may spend obols to restore `IP`, `HP` and/or `MP`
* Outpost: When you **reset**, you can choose to restart your Travel at an `Outpost` instead. However you will only regain half of your maximum `HP`, `MP` and `IP`. A Mind Maze can only have one `Outpost`
* Empty: Nothing of interest appears in the shard.

> [!NOTE]
> Here are the breakdown of the number of shard cards. As you purchase beneficial upgrades via `Insight`, the number of cards for each kind of shard will change:
> 
> * Challenge x 4
> * Conflict x 4
> * Investigation x 2
> * Treasure x 2
> * Event x 2
> * Rest x 1
> * Merchant x 2
> * Shrine x 2

## Type of Paths

> [!NOTE]
> Hint: When you survey or enter a `path`, a random card is drawn to determine the nature of the `path`, and then the card is discarded. The deck of path cards is only shuffled when all `path` cards are drawn.

* Normal: Nothing happens on this path.
* Delight: You don't deduct `Stability` when travelling through this path. Otherwise it's like a Normal path.
* Toll: You must spend obols to cross this path. If you are unable to afford `obols`, either spend `FP` or reduce `Stability`.
* Drain: You must spend `MP` to cross this path
* Loss: You must spend `IP` to cross this path
* Pain: You must spend `HP` to cross this path
* Fortune: You may gain `MP`, `HP`, `IP` or `Obol` when crossing this path
* Woe: You gain a random status effect when crossing this path
* Dull: Usually paired with one element. When any PC deals element of this damage, its damage is halved. This is applied after resistances and vulnerabilities are taken into account.
* Paradox: In the next shard, when you need to roll a certain stat for an `Ability Check` (hence doesn't apply to `Accuracy Checks` in combat), you must instead roll its counterpart:
	* `MIG` <-> `INS`
	* `DEX` <-> `WLP`
* Reverse Gate: In the next shard, when you would gain or lose `MP`, lose `HP` instead. When you would gain or lose `MP`, lose `HP` instead
* Succor: All PCs choose one: restore `20 HP`, restore `20 MP` or remove one status effect.

> [!NOTE]
> In the initial deck of `path` cards, there:
> * 4 `Normal` paths
> * 1 `Delight` path
> * 2 `Drain` paths
> * 2 `Loss` paths
> * 2 `Pain` paths
> * 2 `Fortune` paths
> * 2 `Woe` paths
> * 2 `Dull` paths
> * 1 `Paradox` path
> * 1 `Reverse` path
> * 1 `Succor` path

You can spend `Insight` to purchase benefits that add more beneficial paths to the deck.
# Roles while Traveling
While travelling through the Mind Shard, there are a few roles which the party members can take on.

## Choosing a Role
At the start of each travel turn, the PCs decide whether to take on a role each. A role can only be filled by exactly **one** PC, with the exception of the `Rest` role. Observe the following rules for choosing roles:
* Every role has a cooldown of 1 `travel turn`. This means no roles can be chosen twice consecutively. 
* A PC that takes on a role this `travel turn` must choose the `rest` role next turn.
## The Roles

### The Pathfinder
Pathfinder: The role of the Pathfinder is to ensure that the party does not suffer the negative consequences of travelling through a path. The check usually is `DEX` + `INS`. If your character has a bond or expertise related to path, roll and add a `d4` for each and add them as bonus to the  roll.
* On 9-: You suffer the full consequences of the path
* On 10 - 14: You suffer limited consequences of the path
* On15+: You do not suffer any setback

### The Scout
The role of the Scout is to survey the **kind** of paths and shards. The check is an open check, usually involving `INS` + `WLP`. If your character has a bond or expertise related to path, roll and add a `d4` for each and add them as bonus to the roll. When you **survey** a path or shard, its nature (but not its exact description) is revealed. When selecting a shard or path to survey, it must be adjacent to your current shard **or** adjacent to the a path or shard which you have just surveyed.
* On a result of **4 or lesser:** You learn nothing.
* On a result of 5 - 9: You survey one path and/or shard.
* On a result of 10 - 14: You survey two paths and/or shards.
* On a result of 15+: You survey three paths and/or shards.

### The Watcher
Things usually go awry while travelling in a Mind Shard. There might be things that are out of place in a memory shard. The check is usually `INS` + `WLP`. If your character has a bond or expertise related to path, roll and add a `d4` for each and add them as bonus to the roll.
* On a result of 4 or lesser: Something bad occurs.
* On a result of 5 - 9: If the Stability Clock is 5 or less, something bad occurs.
* On a result of 10+: You found useful items or information.
* On a result of 15+: You found twice the amount of useful items.

### The Guardian
The Guardian ensures the safety of the party. When entering a shard, the Guardian rolls `MIG` + `DEX`. 
* The Guardian gains a number of `Protection Tokens` base on the results:
	* On a result of 4 or lesser, no tokens are gained and you suffer some setback.
	* On a result of 5 - 9, you gain 1 token but you suffer some setback.
	* On a result of 10+, you gain 2 tokens.
	* On a result of 15+, you gain 3 tokens.
* Here's what you can spend a token on (once per round, for combat abilities):
	* Restore 20 `HP` to one ally as a free reaction in combat.
	* Restore 20 `MP` to one ally as a free action in combat.
	* Intercept once (but no more than one Intercept per round).
	* Grant one ally 10 `Shields` as a free action in combat.
	* Traveling this turn doesn't cost Stability.

### The Diplomat
The Diplomat acts as the spokesperson of the group. The Diplomat makes a roll when the party enters a shard that contains NPCs, which is usually `INS + WLP` (The stat varies depends on the type of NPCs), to see if the NPCs' disposition changes. Friendly NPCs are less likely to engage in combat and trade more favorably with you. If your character has a bond or expertise related to path, roll and add a `d4` for each and add them as bonus to the roll.
* On 9 or less: The disposition of the NPCs drop by one rank.
* On 10 - 14: The disposition of the NPCs remain the same.
* On 15+: The disposition of the NPCs increase by one rank.

### The Petitioner
The Petitioner is the required role to **unlock** or **activate** a Boon.
* If the Boon is from a shard, the carrier of the shard must be the Petitioner.
* If the Boon is from an Icon, the character must be affiliated with the Icon to be the Petitioner.

### The Supporter
PCs assign here may support any of the other roles that require an `Ability Check` , such as the `Diplomat` or `Pathfinder`.
### Rest
A PC which has taken on a role in the past `travel turn` must rest.
Any PCs not involved in any other roles also automatically rest.  For those PCs, they get a `well-rested` bonus, which grants a `+2` bonus to all `Ability Checks` out of combat.

# Stability
The `Stability` of a Mind Maze affects the difficulty of the checks. There are three `Tiers` of `Stability`, each represented by a clock of three segments each: `excellent`, `stable`, and `unstable`. Once the `unstable` clock is depleted, the Mind Maze will enter the `crisis` tier.

If you have an ability that restores `Stability`, unless stated otherwise, it cannot raise restored depleted clocks. For example, if the Mind Maze is now in `Stable` clock with 1 segments checked, and you have an ability that restores `2 Stability`, you will uncheck 1 segment in `Stable` but is unable to uncheck 1 segment in the `Excellent` clock.

* **Excellent:**
	* When entering conflict, all enemies take `15` untyped damage.
	* All `Ability Checks` are made with a `+2` bonus.
* Stable
	* No effects
* **Unstable**
	* When combat begins, all enemies gain an extra `15 HP` and `15 MP` that can go beyond the maximum.
	* When combat begins, all PCs loses `10%` of their max `HP` and `MP`
	* Before the first round of combat, one enemy NPC gets to take an extra turn
* **Crisis**
	* At the start of each travel turn, all PCs loses `10%` of their max `HP` and `MP`
	* When combat begins, all enemies gain an extra `25 HP` and `25 MP` that can go beyond the maximum.
	* When combat begins, all PCs loses `10%` of their max `HP` and `MP`
	* Before the first round of combat, two enemy NPCs gets to take an extra turn
