`Feats` are like `Rituals`, except those are usable by those without magic. Different classes now provide different possible `Feats`. For example, the `Thief` class provides the `Skulduggery` , which allows you to spend `MP` to bypass security, palm stolen items and etc.

## Feats vs. Ability Checks
A `Feat` differs from a usual `Ability Check` in that:
* The character needs to spend `MP`
* The effect can be superhuman or extraordinary, though they are cheaper in `MP` cost than `Rituals`
* The `DL` is usually lower than a straight `Ability Check`
A `Feat` differs from a usual `Ritual` in that:
* `Rituals` are more flexible than `Feats`
* `Rituals` can work against magical effects better than `Feats`

Below are the potency table for `Feats`

|Potency|MP|DL|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|Superior|10|7|Perform an act that even those professionally trained will have a high chance of failure.|
|Extraordinary|20|10|Perform an act that is borderline supernatural or only achievable by low level magic, or will require a lot amount of preparation time|
|Legendary|30|12|Perform an act that is clearly supernatural and achievable by high level magic, or will require much planning and coordination|

The GM can experiment with bonds, `FP` and `plot twist` to manipulate the `MP` cost:
* A `plot twist` can be used for an Extraordinary `feat`. 
* If the PC spend a `FP` to justify preparation time, the `MP` cost for an Extraordinary and above `feat` can be reduced by `10`. 

## Restriction of Feats
All the restriction of a `ritual` applies to `feats` as well. Most unnamed characters shouldn't be able to overcome the effects of a `ritual`. If there is a villain or the presence of a named NPC in the midst, they will have to make an `ability check` vs the `check result` of the `feat`. On success, the GM may rule either the NPC is immune or suffers a less serve effect. Villains can always spend a `UP` to reduce the effect that a `feat` has on them by a significant degree, or to have no effect at all.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of this rule, remember that `feats`, having the same restrictions of a `ritual` cannot do direct damage, reduce `MP` or inflict `status effects`.
